## Prolog constraints over MECCG
Uses SWI-Prolog, Pengines, and meccg data and images to allow users to run queries and view matching cards, one at a time, with backtracking in the case of multiple matches.

Importantly, the query starts with `card(C)` and any further constraints are up to the user. You can include any predicates supported by the Pengines sandbox.

A demo of this is hosted at http://jekbox.com:8000
