- [ ] Pengines.js - Contribute the following
  - [ ] removing JQuery dependency (look to use modern JS)
    - [ ] if not possible, at least remove its implicit dependency by making it explicit
  - [ ] fix web/Node.js compatability
    - [ ] make sure library can be used with and without
  - [ ] setup npm publishing of latest versions again
- [ ] once Pengines.js issues sorted, look into better way to handle various JS (Pengines, Tau, hopefully not JQuery) resources (maybe bundling, maybe use something like React for frontend anyway)
